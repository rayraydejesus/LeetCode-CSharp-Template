Use this template to showcase your leetcode progress, OOP skills and input parsing via github.

**Description**
------------------
üò° I created this template because I was tired of seeing my github activity decay while practicing data structures and alogrithms.

I've included <em>[Problem 1 Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)</em> with the template to showcase the entire process of implementing a question within the console app.

- Use this repo as a way to practice input parsing.
- Use this repo as a way to practice OOP with SOLID in mind utilizing the built in interfaces I've created and examples I've set forth.
